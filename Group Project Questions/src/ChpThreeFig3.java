 *  In this exercise, create a class called 'square' with a 'sideLength' parameter. Within it, create instance methods used
 *  to calculate the square's perimeter and area. When writing the class' constructor, do so in such a way that the methods
 *  are initialized when creating an instance of the square class. DO NOT use the default constructor.
